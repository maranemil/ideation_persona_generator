### DM-GY 6053 Ideation and Prototyping Tandon Online

# Schedule

**All dates and assignments are subject to change at the discretion of the professor! Gitbook and slack are the official sources for all dates and assignments.**

*Gitbook & Slack are living, dynamic sources. If there are any changes to the schedule in the syllabus, I will note these changes on gitbook and/or slack AND in person during the synchronous online class session.* Active learning requires flexibility and the investigation of unforeseen paths which may diverge from the specifics outlined below.
