# Project 2 Ideation

## Objectives

- Review Project 2 requirements
- Ideate project ideas
- Break down possible features
- Create wireframes (paper prototyping, sketch, illustrator, graph paper, balsamiq, etc) for your project

## Intro

Now that you've had some time to consider APIs and MVC frameworks, it's time to construct a rough plan for your second project. We'll work on getting some firm ideas down on paper, so your project is more manageable.

## Ideation

Create the idea for your project following the steps covered in our UX Crashcourse:

1. What am I making?
2. Why am I making it in the first place?
3. Why would people use it?
4. What kind of people will use it?
5. How do I make it the best resource for them?

Since we're just getting your MVC toolbelt set up, your project isn't required to be as revolutionary as what we brainstormed in the UX Crashcourse - but, you should still follow these basic steps to ensure a quality result.

## Features

In the coming week, we'll go indepth with ways to define models - but for today, start by writing down a list of "features" you'd want your app to perform. These can be things like:

1. Post a collection of song data into a page
2. Sort an list of stock listing by price
3. Accept a query in a form that makes an API request

Having a list of these basic functions will help you in the wireframing proccess, and in your project planning in general.

## Wireframing

Wireframes are low-fidelity sketches of how your app will look and operate:

There's a variety of tools you can use to accomplish this:
- Pen and Paper
- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
- [Adobe Suite (Photoshop/Illustrator)](http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html)
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

BONUS: If you go the digital route and create someting in Sketch or Adobe, you can prototype even more effectively with [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) and [CRAFT](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft).
